## EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

### **PRE-EXECUTION (Agent Initialization)**

```
Agent Setup:
1. Load all mandatory references into memory (context)
2. Parse DOCUMENTATION/PARTITION_STRATEGY_BY_TABLE.md for table classifications
3. Identify next unprocessed table (start with Category A1)
4. Review table strategy (CHAIN_ID or AUDIT_TIMESTAMP)
5. Verify partition infrastructure exists (pf_ChainID_EPS, ps_ChainID_EPS)
6. Initialize execution log and report template
```

**Decision Point:**
- ✅ All references loaded? → Proceed to TABLE SELECTION
- ❌ Missing reference? → STOP - Alert to load missing file

---

### **TABLE SELECTION (Agent Decision)**

```
Process:
1. Read: DOCUMENTATION/PARTITION_STRATEGY_BY_TABLE.md
2. Find: Next incomplete table from Category A1 (highest priority)
   Priority Order:
   A1: PATIENT (✅ DONE), ADDRESS, RX_TX, PRESCRIBER, MRN, CARD, PAYMENT, LINE_ITEM, ALLERGY, DISEASE
3. Verify: Table not already in /EXECUTION_REPORTS/
4. Select: TABLE_NAME
5. Confirm: Partitioning strategy (CHAIN_ID for Category A1)

Output:
- TABLE_NAME = [selected]
- STRATEGY = CHAIN_ID (or AUDIT_TIMESTAMP for Category B)
- PRIORITY = A1 (or A2/A3/B1/B2/B3/C)
```

---

### **5-PHASE EXECUTION (Use PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md for exact steps)**

**IMPORTANT:** Do not follow the detailed phases below. Instead, follow **PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md** which contains the proven successful pattern.

All detailed phase instructions that follow are maintained for reference only. For actual execution, use PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md Steps 0-9.

---

### **REFERENCE ONLY - Phase-by-Phase Details (See PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md instead)**

```
Step 1.1: Table Existence Check
├─ Query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EPS.[TABLE_NAME]
├─ Expected: Row count ≥ 0
├─ Record: Current row count in execution log
└─ Decision: ✅ Proceed / ❌ STOP (table not found)

Step 1.2: CHAIN_ID Column Verification
├─ Query: SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE, IS_NULLABLE 
│          FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
│          WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='EPS' AND TABLE_NAME='[TABLE_NAME]' AND COLUMN_NAME='CHAIN_ID'
├─ Expected: CHAIN_ID, INT or BIGINT
├─ Record: Column type, nullable status
└─ Decision: ✅ Proceed / ❌ STOP (column not found/wrong type)

Step 1.3: Primary Key Identification
├─ Query: SELECT CONSTRAINT_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS 
│          WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='EPS' AND TABLE_NAME='[TABLE_NAME]' 
│          AND CONSTRAINT_TYPE='PRIMARY KEY'
├─ Expected: One PK constraint name
├─ Record: PK name (e.g., PK_[TABLE_NAME])
└─ Decision: ✅ Proceed / ❌ STOP (no PK)

Step 1.4: Get Original PK Column Structure
├─ Query: SELECT c.name, ic.key_ordinal FROM sys.index_columns ic
│          JOIN sys.columns c ON ic.object_id=c.object_id AND ic.column_id=c.column_id
│          WHERE ic.object_id=OBJECT_ID('EPS.[TABLE_NAME]') AND ic.index_id=1
│          ORDER BY ic.key_ordinal
├─ Expected: Original PK columns in order (e.g., ID, RX_COM_ID)
├─ Record: Original structure for Phase 3 (new PK will prepend CHAIN_ID)
└─ Build: New PK formula = (CHAIN_ID, [ORIGINAL_PK_COLS])

Step 1.5: Foreign Key Inventory
├─ Query: SELECT name FROM sys.foreign_keys 
│          WHERE parent_object_id=OBJECT_ID('EPS.[TABLE_NAME]') 
│          OR referenced_object_id=OBJECT_ID('EPS.[TABLE_NAME]')
├─ Expected: FK list (may be empty)
├─ Record: All FK names and classification:
│  ├─ Type A: parent_object_id=[TABLE_NAME] → External FKs (keep)
│  └─ Type B: referenced_object_id=[TABLE_NAME] → Child table FKs (drop/recreate)
└─ Decision: For each Type B FK, note which child table

Step 1.6: Partition Infrastructure Verification
├─ Query 1: SELECT name FROM sys.partition_functions WHERE name='pf_ChainID_EPS'
├─ Query 2: SELECT name FROM sys.partition_schemes WHERE name='ps_ChainID_EPS'
├─ Expected: Both return 1 row each
├─ Record: Infrastructure confirmed
└─ Decision: ✅ Proceed / ⚠️ CREATE (one-time setup only)
```

**Phase 1 Output:**
```
✅ Pre-Execution Checklist Completed
- Table verified to exist: [ROW_COUNT] rows
- CHAIN_ID column: [TYPE], [NULL_STATUS]
- Primary key: [PK_NAME] with columns ([COLS])
- Foreign keys identified: [N] total
  ├─ External FKs: [N]
  └─ Child table FKs: [N]
- Partition infrastructure ready: ✅
```

---

#### **PHASE 2: FOREIGN KEY MANAGEMENT (5-10 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Remove FK constraints blocking PK modification

**Steps:** (Follow PARTITION_IMPLEMENTATION_RULEBOOK.md Steps 2.1-2.2)

```
Step 2.1: Drop Child Table FKs
├─ For each FK where referenced_object_id=[TABLE_NAME]:
├─ Execute: ALTER TABLE EPS.[CHILD_TABLE] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK_NAME]
├─ Expected: Success (FK removed)
├─ Error: "Constraint not found" → Already dropped, continue
├─ Record: Which FKs dropped (name and child table)
└─ Verify: No constraint violation errors

Step 2.2: Drop This Table's External FKs
├─ For each FK where parent_object_id=[TABLE_NAME]:
├─ Execute: ALTER TABLE EPS.[TABLE_NAME] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK_NAME]
├─ Expected: Success (FK removed from this table)
├─ Record: Which external FKs dropped
└─ Verify: All FKs removed
```

**Phase 2 Output:**
```
✅ Foreign Keys Managed
- Child table FKs dropped: [LIST] (N total)
- External FKs dropped: [LIST] (N total)
- Status: All FKs removed successfully
```

**Error Handling:**
- If "Cannot drop - still referenced" → Go back and drop referencing FKs first
- If FK already missing → Record but continue

---

#### **PHASE 3: PRIMARY KEY MODIFICATION (2-5 minutes - TABLE LOCKED)**

**Purpose:** Move PK from non-partitioned to partitioned structure

**⚠️ WARNING:** Table will be locked 1-5 minutes during Step 3.2

**Steps:** (Follow PARTITION_IMPLEMENTATION_RULEBOOK.md Steps 3.1-3.2)

```
Step 3.1: Drop Original Primary Key
├─ Execute: ALTER TABLE EPS.[TABLE_NAME] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK_NAME]
├─ Expected: Success
├─ Error "Referenced by FK": Go back to Phase 2, drop FKs completely
├─ Record: Original PK dropped at [TIME]
└─ Timestamp: Note time for lock duration measurement

Step 3.2: Create Partitioned Primary Key
├─ Build SQL: 
│  ALTER TABLE EPS.[TABLE_NAME] 
│  ADD CONSTRAINT [PK_NAME] 
│  PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (CHAIN_ID, [ORIGINAL_PK_COLS]) 
│  ON ps_ChainID_EPS(CHAIN_ID)
├─ Execute: Query
├─ Expected: Success with temporary table lock (1-5 minutes)
├─ Error "Duplicate key": Stop - data has duplicate (CHAIN_ID, PK) values
│   Resolution: Run duplicate check and resolve data issues
├─ Error "Referenced by FK": Stop - FKs not fully dropped, go back to Phase 2
├─ Record: New PK created at [TIME]
└─ Timestamp: Note end time for lock duration
```

**Phase 3 Output:**
```
✅ Primary Key Partitioned
- Original PK dropped: [PK_NAME] at [TIME]
- New partitioned PK created: [PK_NAME] on ps_ChainID_EPS at [TIME]
- Table lock duration: [X] minutes
- Partition key: CHAIN_ID (position 1) ✅
```

**Error Recovery:**
```
IF Duplicate Key Error:
  1. Query: SELECT CHAIN_ID, [PK_COL], COUNT(*) FROM EPS.[TABLE_NAME]
           GROUP BY CHAIN_ID, [PK_COL] HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  2. Record duplicates found
  3. Decision: Remove duplicates or adjust PK structure
  4. Retry Step 3.2 after resolution
  
IF FK Still Referenced:
  1. Query: SELECT name FROM sys.foreign_keys 
           WHERE parent_object_id=OBJECT_ID('EPS.[TABLE_NAME]')
  2. Drop any remaining FKs
  3. Retry Phase 3
```

---

#### **PHASE 4: FOREIGN KEY RECREATION (5-15 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Restore referential integrity with CHAIN_ID component

**Steps:** (Follow PARTITION_IMPLEMENTATION_RULEBOOK.md Steps 4.1-4.2)

```
Step 4.1: Recreate External FKs
├─ For each FK from Phase 2 Step 2.2:
├─ Build SQL: ALTER TABLE EPS.[TABLE_NAME] 
│             ADD CONSTRAINT [FK_NAME] 
│             FOREIGN KEY ([FK_COLS]) 
│             REFERENCES [REF_TABLE]([REF_COLS])
├─ Execute: Each FK
├─ Expected: Success
├─ Error "Column not found": Referenced table structure issue
├─ Record: Which external FKs recreated
└─ Verify: All external FKs restored

Step 4.2: Recreate Child Table FKs
├─ For each FK from Phase 2 Step 2.1:
├─ Key Rule: FK MUST include CHAIN_ID on both sides
├─ Build SQL: ALTER TABLE EPS.[CHILD_TABLE] 
│             ADD CONSTRAINT [FK_NAME] 
│             FOREIGN KEY ([FK_COLS], CHAIN_ID) 
│             REFERENCES EPS.[TABLE_NAME]([PK_COLS], CHAIN_ID)
├─ Execute: Each FK
├─ Expected: Success
├─ Error "Child table missing CHAIN_ID": Data migration needed first
├─ Record: Which child FKs recreated
└─ Verify: All child FKs restored
```

**Phase 4 Output:**
```
✅ Foreign Keys Recreated
- External FKs: [N] recreated
- Child table FKs: [N] recreated
- Total FKs restored: [N]
- Status: Referential integrity maintained
```

**Error Recovery:**
```
IF Child Table Missing CHAIN_ID:
  1. Note: Child table [TABLE_NAME] missing CHAIN_ID
  2. Action: Schedule child table FK recreation after CHAIN_ID added
  3. Workaround: Recreate FK without CHAIN_ID (if acceptable)
  4. Record: Document deviation from standard
```

---

#### **PHASE 5: VERIFICATION (10 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Confirm partitioning applied successfully

**Steps:** (Use VERIFY_PARTITIONS_QUERIES.sql - Queries 1-6 are CRITICAL)

```
Verification Query 1: Partition Function Exists
├─ Execute: SELECT name, type_desc, boundary_value_on_right 
           FROM sys.partition_functions WHERE name='pf_ChainID_EPS'
├─ Expected: ✅ PASS (1 row: pf_ChainID_EPS, RANGE, False)
├─ Record: Result
└─ Decision: ✅ Continue / ❌ STOP (function missing)

Verification Query 2: Partition Scheme Exists & Mapped
├─ Execute: SELECT ps.name, ds.name FROM sys.partition_schemes ps 
           JOIN sys.destination_data_spaces dds ON ps.data_space_id=dds.partition_scheme_id
           JOIN sys.data_spaces ds ON dds.data_space_id=ds.data_space_id
           WHERE ps.name='ps_ChainID_EPS'
├─ Expected: ✅ PASS (6-7 rows: all FilegroupName=PRIMARY)
├─ Record: Partition count and filegroup mapping
└─ Decision: ✅ Continue / ❌ STOP (scheme missing/misconfigured)

Verification Query 3: Table Using Partition Scheme
├─ Execute: SELECT i.name, ps.name FROM sys.indexes i 
           LEFT JOIN sys.partition_schemes ps ON i.data_space_id=ps.data_space_id
           WHERE i.object_id=OBJECT_ID('EPS.[TABLE_NAME]') AND i.index_id=1
├─ Expected: ✅ PASS (PK_[TABLE_NAME] → ps_ChainID_EPS)
├─ Record: PK name and assigned partition scheme
└─ Decision: ✅ Continue / ❌ STOP (PK not on partition scheme)

Verification Query 4: All 6 Partitions Allocated
├─ Execute: SELECT partition_number, [rows] FROM sys.partitions 
           WHERE object_id=OBJECT_ID('EPS.[TABLE_NAME]') AND index_id=1
           ORDER BY partition_number
├─ Expected: ✅ PASS (6 rows: partition_number 1-6)
├─ Record: Partition count and row distribution
└─ Decision: ✅ Continue / ❌ STOP (partitions not allocated)

Verification Query 5: PK Column Structure Correct

           WHERE ic.object_id=OBJECT_ID('EPS.[TABLE_NAME]') AND ic.index_id=1
           ORDER BY ic.key_ordinal
├─ Expected: ✅ PASS (Column 1=CHAIN_ID, Column 2+=Original PK)
├─ Record: PK column order
└─ Decision: ✅ Continue / ❌ STOP (wrong column order - CHAIN_ID not first!)

Verification Query 6: Partition Key Correct
├─ Execute: SELECT i.name, c.name, ic.partition_ordinal FROM sys.indexes i
           JOIN sys.index_columns ic ON i.object_id=ic.object_id AND i.index_id=ic.index_id
           JOIN sys.columns c ON ic.object_id=c.object_id AND ic.column_id=c.column_id
           WHERE i.object_id=OBJECT_ID('EPS.[TABLE_NAME]') AND i.index_id=1
           AND ic.partition_ordinal > 0
├─ Expected: ✅ PASS (PartitionKeyColumn=CHAIN_ID, partition_ordinal=1)
├─ Record: Partition key column and ordinal
└─ Decision: ✅ Continue / ❌ CRITICAL (partition key is NOT CHAIN_ID!)

Result Decision:
├─ ✅ All 6 queries PASS → PARTITIONING VERIFIED SUCCESSFUL
├─ ⚠️ 1-2 queries FAIL → Review failed query, troubleshoot
└─ ❌ >2 queries FAIL → Potential PK structure issue, review Phase 3

### **POST-EXECUTION (Agent Finalization)**

#### **Step 6: Generate Execution Report**

```
Purpose: Document entire execution for audit trail

Use Template from: PARTITION_IMPLEMENTATION_RULEBOOK.md (section DOCUMENTATION & REPORTING)

Report Sections (Auto-populate from execution log):
1. Metadata
   - Table: [TABLE_NAME]
   - Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   - Duration: Phase 1 (X min), Phase 2 (X min), Phase 3 (X min), Phase 4 (X min), Phase 5 (X min)
   - Total: [X] minutes

2. Pre-Execution Analysis (from Phase 1)
   - Row count: [N]
   - CHAIN_ID type: [TYPE]
   - PK: [PK_NAME]
   - FKs: [COUNT]

3. Execution Phases (from Phases 2-5)
   - Phase 2: [N] FKs dropped
   - Phase 3: PK recreated, lock duration [X] minutes
   - Phase 4: [N] FKs recreated
   - Phase 5: All 6 queries PASSED

4. Verification Results
   - Query 1: ✅ PASS
   - Query 2: ✅ PASS
   - ... all 6 queries

5. Summary
   - Status: ✅ COMPLETE
   - Data loss: ZERO
   - Next table: [NEXT_TABLE_NAME]

Save to: /EXECUTION_REPORTS/[TABLE_NAME]_PARTITION_EXECUTION_[YYYY-MM-DD].md
```

---

#### **Step 7: Update Progress Tracking**

```
Purpose: Maintain rollout status

File to Update: /PARTITION_ROLLOUT_SUMMARY.md

Update Action:
1. Open PARTITION_ROLLOUT_SUMMARY.md
2. Find: Category A1 table section
3. Update: Status from "PENDING" to "✅ COMPLETE"
4. Add: Completion date [YYYY-MM-DD], duration [X] minutes
5. Record: Any issues encountered (or "None")
6. Increment: Progress counter (N of 73 for Category A)

Format:
| # | Table | Status | Date | Duration | Issues |
|---|-------|--------|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | PATIENT | ✅ | 2026-06-26 | 45 min | None |
| 2 | [TABLE_NAME] | ✅ | [DATE] | [TIME] | [ISSUES/None] |

Progress Metric: N/73 Category A complete (estimate time remaining)
```

---

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

**PRIMARY SOURCE:** Use decision trees and error handling in PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md Steps 0-9

This section provides additional context for understanding when to proceed or stop.

### **When to PROCEED vs STOP**

```
PROCEED IF:
✅ Table exists with data
✅ CHAIN_ID column exists (INT or BIGINT)
✅ Primary key exists and identifiable
✅ Partition function pf_ChainID_EPS exists
✅ Partition scheme ps_ChainID_EPS exists
✅ All 6 verification queries PASS

STOP & REPORT IF:
❌ Table not found → Cannot locate table
❌ CHAIN_ID missing → Cannot partition without partition key
❌ No primary key → Partitioning requires PK
❌ Partition infrastructure missing → One-time setup required
❌ Duplicate key error in Phase 3 → Data quality issue
❌ >2 verification queries FAIL → PK structure problem

ESCALATE IF:
⚠️ Child table missing CHAIN_ID → Requires upstream data migration
⚠️ FK constraint conflict → Referential integrity issue
⚠️ Lock exceeds 10 minutes → Potential locking contention
```

---

## CRITICAL RULES (Non-Negotiable)

**EXECUTION REFERENCE:** Detailed step-by-step implementation of these rules is in PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md

Agent MUST follow these rules EXACTLY:

```
Rule 1: PARTITION KEY
├─ Always CHAIN_ID (non-negotiable)
├─ Must be FIRST column in new PK (Rule CHANGE from earlier versions)
├─ Data type: INT or BIGINT
└─ Cannot be NULL for partitioning
└─ Implementation: PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md STEP 5 - Recreate PK on Partition Scheme
└─ **NEW:** If nullable, fix in STEP 3.5 before creating PK

Rule 2: HANDLE NULLABLE PK COLUMNS (NEW - addresses DISEASE issue)
├─ Issue: SSMA migrations may create HEAP tables with nullable PK columns
├─ Detection: Step 0.8 checks if CHAIN_ID or ID are nullable
├─ Fix: ALTER TABLE column_name ALTER COLUMN column_name bigint NOT NULL
├─ When: Execute before creating PK (STEP 3.5)
├─ Safety: Safe because tables have 0 rows during migration phase
└─ Example: DISEASE table required this fix (June 28, 2026)

Rule 2: PARTITION BOUNDARIES
├─ Always: 1000, 5000, 50000, 100000, 130000
├─ Type: RANGE LEFT
├─ Cannot be modified
└─ Creates 6 partitions (P1-P6)

Rule 3: PARTITION SCHEME REUSE
├─ Always use ps_ChainID_EPS (never create new)
├─ All partitions map to PRIMARY filegroup
├─ Cannot change mapping
└─ One-time infrastructure setup

Rule 4: PRIMARY KEY STRUCTURE (CHANGE: CHAIN_ID now FIRST)
├─ New PK = (CHAIN_ID, [ORIGINAL_PK_COLS]) ← CHAIN_ID is now FIRST!
├─ CHAIN_ID MUST be first column (position 1)
├─ Original column order preserved in positions 2+
├─ On partition scheme ps_ChainID_EPS(CHAIN_ID)
└─ Implementation: PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md STEP 5

Rule 5: FOREIGN KEY MAPPING (Column Order Critical)
├─ External FKs: Preserve exactly
├─ Child table FKs: MUST include CHAIN_ID on both sides
├─ Column order MUST match parent PK order exactly
│  ├─ If parent PK = (CHAIN_ID, ID), child FK = (ID_CHILD, CHAIN_ID)
│  ├─ If parent PK = (ID, CHAIN_ID), child FK = (ID_CHILD, CHAIN_ID)
│  └─ Column order is determined by parent PK position order
├─ Cannot reference table without CHAIN_ID component
├─ Referential integrity non-negotiable
└─ Implementation: PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md STEP 7

Rule 6: VERIFICATION MANDATORY
├─ All 6 verification queries MUST pass
├─ No table marked complete without verification
├─ Cannot proceed to next table if verification fails
├─ Verification queries are immutable (copy exactly)
└─ Implementation: PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md STEP 9 (all 6 queries provided)

Rule 7: DATA INTEGRITY
├─ Zero tolerance for data loss
├─ All existing data preserved through partitioning
├─ Backup/rollback procedures available
├─ Before-after row count must match
└─ Implementation: Monitor during PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md STEP 5 (PK recreation)

Rule 8: DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED
├─ Execution report mandatory for each table
├─ Pre-flight checks documented (Step 0)
├─ FKs and indexes documented (Steps 1-3)
├─ Lock duration recorded (Step 5)
├─ All 6 verification query results recorded (Step 9)
└─ Report location: /EXECUTION_REPORTS/[TABLE_NAME]_[DATE].md
```

**Column Order Example (CRITICAL for FK Recreation):**

RX_TX Table Example:
```
RX_TX PK = (CHAIN_ID, ID)
  └─ Column 1: CHAIN_ID
  └─ Column 2: ID

Child table COMPOUND_INGREDIENTS has FK to RX_TX:
  └─ FK columns in COMPOUND_INGREDIENTS: ID_RX_TX (maps to ID), CHAIN_ID
  └─ FK declaration: FOREIGN KEY (ID_RX_TX, CHAIN_ID) REFERENCES EPS.RX_TX(ID, CHAIN_ID)
  └─ Why: Column order matches parent PK (CHAIN_ID=position2→maps to ID_RX_TX, ID_COLUMN→maps to ID)
```

PATIENT Table Example:
```
PATIENT PK = (CHAIN_ID, PATIENT_ID)
  └─ Column 1: CHAIN_ID
  └─ Column 2: PATIENT_ID

Child table ADDRESS has FK to PATIENT:
  └─ FK columns in ADDRESS: PATIENT_ID, CHAIN_ID
  └─ FK declaration: FOREIGN KEY (PATIENT_ID, CHAIN_ID) REFERENCES EPS.PATIENT(PATIENT_ID, CHAIN_ID)
  └─ Why: Direct column name match (PATIENT_ID→PATIENT_ID, CHAIN_ID→CHAIN_ID)
```

**Implementation Instructions:**
- Always follow PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md Steps 0-9 in exact order
- For Step 7 (Recreate Child FKs), use the column order rules shown above
- Never deviate from the proven pattern
- If you encounter an error, consult PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md error handling in the relevant step
├─ Report saved to /EXECUTION_REPORTS/
├─ Progress tracked in rollout summary
└─ No table closure without report

Rule 9: TABLE LOCKING
├─ Phase 3 will lock table 1-5 minutes
├─ Expected and acceptable
├─ Document lock duration
└─ No queries allowed during lock (normal)

Rule 10: ERROR HANDLING
├─ Follow error recovery procedures in rulebook
├─ Never force through failures
├─ Always investigate root cause
├─ Escalate unresolvable errors
└─ Record all errors and resolutions
```

## ERROR HANDLING MATRIX

```
ERROR TYPE | ROOT CAUSE | SOLUTION | REFERENCE
-----------|-----------|----------|----------
FK Constraint Violation | FKs not dropped | Drop all FKs in Phase 2 | PARTITION_IMPLEMENTATION_RULEBOOK.md Issue 1
Cannot Drop PK | Still referenced by FK | Recursive FK search | PARTITION_PROCESS_FLOW.md Error Tree
Duplicate Key Error | Data integrity issue | Check & resolve duplicates | PARTITION_IMPLEMENTATION_RULEBOOK.md Issue 3
Syntax Error | Reserved keywords | Bracket all keywords | PARTITION_IMPLEMENTATION_RULEBOOK.md Issue 4
CHAIN_ID Not Found | Wrong schema/case | Verify exact column name | PARTITION_PROCESS_FLOW.md Step 1.2
Partition Not Allocated | Infrastructure issue | Verify pf_ChainID_EPS exists | VERIFY_PARTITIONS_QUERIES.sql Query 1
Lock Timeout | High contention | Retry during off-peak | PARTITION_IMPLEMENTATION_RULEBOOK.md Rule 9
FK Column Mismatch | Child table structure | Add missing column first | PARTITION_IMPLEMENTATION_RULEBOOK.md Issue 5
Cannot Define PK on Nullable | SSMA HEAP table issue | Execute STEP 3.5: ALTER COLUMN NOT NULL | PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md STEP 3.5 (NEW)
```

**NEW in v2.1 - DISEASE Issue:**
```
Issue: "Cannot define PRIMARY KEY constraint on nullable column"
Cause: SSMA migrations create HEAP tables with nullable PK columns (e.g., DISEASE table)
Signs: 
  - No clustered index (HEAP table)
  - CHAIN_ID or ID columns show IS_NULLABLE = YES
  
Immediate Fix (STEP 3.5):
  ALTER TABLE EPS.[TABLE_NAME] ALTER COLUMN CHAIN_ID bigint NOT NULL;
  ALTER TABLE EPS.[TABLE_NAME] ALTER COLUMN ID bigint NOT NULL;
  Then proceed to STEP 5 (skip STEP 4 - no PK to drop)

Testing: Applied successfully to DISEASE table on June 28, 2026
Reference: PARTITION_CREATION_PROMPT.md STEP 3.5
```

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW (Loop for All Tables)

```
Agent Main Loop:

INITIALIZE:
├─ Load all references (mandatory)
├─ Check PARTITION_STRATEGY_BY_TABLE.md
├─ Identify next Category A1 table
└─ Ready for execution

FOR EACH TABLE in [ADDRESS, RX_TX, PRESCRIBER, MRN, CARD, PAYMENT, LINE_ITEM, ALLERGY, DISEASE]:
  
  TABLE_SELECTION:
  ├─ Find next incomplete table
  ├─ Verify not already in /EXECUTION_REPORTS/
  └─ Assign TABLE_NAME = [selected]
  
  PHASE 1: PRE-EXECUTION ANALYSIS (10-15 min)
  ├─ Execute all 6 pre-checks (Steps 1.1-1.6)
  ├─ Document findings
  ├─ Decision: ✅ Proceed to Phase 2
  └─ If STOP: Record why and escalate
  
  PHASE 2: FOREIGN KEY MANAGEMENT (5-10 min)
  ├─ Drop child table FKs (Step 2.1)
  ├─ Drop this table's FKs (Step 2.2)
  ├─ Document dropped FKs
  └─ Ready for PK modification
  
  PHASE 3: PRIMARY KEY MODIFICATION (2-5 min)
  ├─ Drop original PK (Step 3.1)
  ├─ Create partitioned PK (Step 3.2)
  ├─ Note: Expect 1-5 min table lock
  └─ Document lock duration
  
  PHASE 4: FOREIGN KEY RECREATION (5-15 min)
  ├─ Recreate external FKs (Step 4.1)
  ├─ Recreate child FKs (Step 4.2)
  ├─ Document recreated FKs
  └─ Verify referential integrity
  
  PHASE 5: VERIFICATION (10 min)
  ├─ Run all 6 verification queries
  ├─ Verify: All queries return ✅ PASS
  ├─ Decision: ✅ Partitioning verified
  └─ If FAIL: Troubleshoot and retry
  
  POST-EXECUTION:
  ├─ Generate execution report (10 min)
  ├─ Save to /EXECUTION_REPORTS/[TABLE_NAME]_PARTITION_EXECUTION_[DATE].md
  ├─ Update PARTITION_ROLLOUT_SUMMARY.md
  ├─ Increment progress counter
  └─ Ready for next table

END LOOP

FINAL STATUS:
├─ All Category A1 tables: ✅ COMPLETE (9 tables)
├─ Proceed to Category A2 (30 tables)
└─ Continue until all 128 tables partitioned
```
